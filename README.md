An interactive memory game called “Discover Telos”, designed to teach key concepts of the Telos blockchain in a fun and visual way. This game can serve as an educational tool, group activity, or resource for presentations on blockchain technology.

The game consists of 12 pairs of cards (24 in total), each representing a fundamental concept of Telos. When correctly matched, the cards reveal a brief explanation or interesting fact about that concept. For example, connecting “TLOS” with “Token” shows that TLOS is the native token of Telos. Other pairs include “BP” with “Block Producer,” “EVM” with “Ethereum Virtual Machine,” and “Governance” with “Voting.”

You can design it in Canva as an interactive presentation, using clickable buttons or animations that reveal the content when clicked. The visual style can be inspired by your interactive space-themed Telos exploration, using colors like Telos blue, black, white, and golden accents to give it a futuristic and tech-savvy look.

Additionally, you can add a bonus dynamic: after each correct match, a reflection question appears, such as “What advantage does Telos offer over other blockchains?” or “How is a Block Producer selected?” This encourages active learning and can be adapted for workshops, community events, or educational sessions.

The difficulty level is adjustable, allowing for more pairs, timers, hints, or even a competitive team mode.
